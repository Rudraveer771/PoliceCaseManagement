# Police Case Management System

## Overview
The Police Case Management System is a web application designed for law enforcement agencies to manage and access criminal case records efficiently. This system provides a user-friendly interface for police personnel to search for cases, view case details, and update records as needed. The application includes role-based access control to ensure that sensitive information is accessed and modified only by authorized personnel.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite (configurable)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Deployment**: Docker (for containerization)

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login for police personnel, with role-based access control.
2. **Case Search & Filter**: Search for cases by parameters like name, case number, location code, or status.
3. **Case Details View**: Detailed view of case information, including ID, DOB, physical attributes, location, and comments.
4. **Database Management**: Authorized users can add, edit, and delete case records.
5. **Audit Logging**: Tracks and logs changes made to case records for accountability.
6. **Responsive Design**: Uses TailwindCSS to ensure the app is responsive and visually appealing across devices.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local environment.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. Make sure to follow best practices for directory structure, reusable components, and secure API calls.
4. Push changes to your forked repository and submit a pull request.

## Security and Vulnerability Management
1. Sensitive data should be managed securely, with environment variables.
2. All API calls should be authorized, and data should be sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
3. Maintain a record of all vulnerabilities reported and resolved.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more granular access control for various user roles.
- Integrate with external APIs for case data enrichment.
- Add real-time notifications for case updates.
